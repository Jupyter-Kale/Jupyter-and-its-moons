## Installation 

We will use the anaconda stack to simplify the installation process. You will need to download Anaconda (Python 3) https://www.anaconda.com/download/ to get started. 

Install instructions for your platform can be found here:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Optionally you can also do this tutorial via docker. If you go this route, we'll assume you already have [[Docker][https://www.docker.com/get-docker]] installed and are familiar with basic Docker concepts since this is not meant to be a Docker tutorial.
